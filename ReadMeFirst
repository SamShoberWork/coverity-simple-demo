2023-09-07 - scnas would not run using a local runner so updated to be a public facing project. i expect the public runner will fail becuase it doenst have access to coverity. 
need to figure out how to get local runner to talk to github. 


2023-09-03  some changes must be made before you can use this demo project 
1) DONE IN MAIN BRANCH - The jenkins file needs to be updated:
    a) set the environment variables - dont use 'https://coverity.chuckaude.com:8443'  - updated to 'https://testing.coverity.synopsys.com'
    b) update the Project name to be 'SLS-hello-java'  from  'hello-java' 
2) the /.github/workflows/coverity-simple.yml requries updating 
    a) add the following environment variables as github secrets to your github project 
              N/A - COVERITY_CHECKERS: --webapp-security
              DONE - COVERITY_URL: ${{ secrets.COVERITY_URL }}   - set to https://testing.coverity.synopsys.com
              DONE - COV_USER: ${{ secrets.COVERITY_USER }}    - set to sshober
              DONE - COVERITY_PASSPHRASE: ${{ secrets.COVERITY_PASSPHRASE }}  -  set to secret password 
    b) do a test save or two to trigger the action 
3) Update the github project to run Actions
4) configure a jenkins server to build the project
    a) do a test build or two to see if the project builds and adds a scan to coverity
